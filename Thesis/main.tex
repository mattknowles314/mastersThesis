\section*{Abstract}
A Neural Network model to predict cricket scores based on certain metrics is presented. These novel results follow on from a look into the current methods used by the International 
Cricket Council for solving the problem of reducing score targets. We present the mathematical background of building and training neural networks, which is an imperative prerequisite to the section devoted
to building the network itself. To aid with this task, all the theory is accompanied by code snippets showing how it is employed in practice. A detailed analysis of the models results is given through three different
datasets. We find that in trying to predict scores, using monte-carlo simmulation to simmulate a match performs significantly worse than not filling in the gaps. We then apply the model to simmulate the 2019 Cricket 
World Cup and see how the tournament would have changed in using the Neural Network model. The comparrison of the model to the current industry standard is naturally important for measuring the success of the model, 
and to test whether or not it would be viable to use instead. 

\section*{Acknowledgements}
The author would like to thank Dr. Jessica Hargreaves for their invaluable supervision, encouragement and advice throughout this project. Secondly, my eternal gratitude and appereciation for my friends in York, who have made my time here so wonderful from the very begining, and for all the support you have given me every step of the way. 
My thanks to Michael Najdan at Kent County Cricket Club for his insight into how data is used in the professional game of cricket. In addition, to Harrison Allen at Yorkshire County Cricket Club for showing me how limited-overs data was put into practice in preperation for games.
Finally, to the UYMCC, who have enriched my university experience beyond belief.
