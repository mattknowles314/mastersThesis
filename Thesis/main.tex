\section*{Abstract}
We present a Neural Network model for predicting scores in the game of cricket. This follows from a discussion the current method employed by the International Cricket Council for resetting score targets when a match is cut short, known as the DLS system \cite{stern}.
Some exploratory data analysis is performed prior to building the model, this is done in order to aid with making model deployment 
decisions later on in the paper. When building the network, we present the mathematical theory accompanied by code snippets detailing the construction. The theory concerns both the actual structure of a neural network, but the algorithms used for training it.
Following on from this, we analyse the model on three test sets of data to measure the performance. Finally, we deploy our model in place of the current DLS method on the games from the 2019 Cricket World Cup to see if the outcome of the tournament differs. 

\section*{Acknowledgements}
The author would like to thank Dr. Jessica Hargreaves for their invaluable supervision, encouragement and advice throughout this project. In addition,
many thanks to Michael Najdan at Kent County Cricket Club for their insight into how data is used in the professional game of cricket, and to Harrison Allen at Yorkshire County Cricket Club for showing me how limited-overs data was put into practice in preperation for games. 
Finally, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my friends from Lindley G; there were times I thought I would never get to write a dissertation, but you all stood by me through some very trying times, and for that I will be forever grateful.
