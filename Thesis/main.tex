\section*{Abstract}
Cricket is a sport very sensitive to interruptions. Light rain or fading light can cause a game to be cut short. For this reason 
the International Cricket Council (ICC) employ a method to reset score targets in such an event. In this dissertation, we explore this method 
before proposing a new method by using Neural Networks to predict scores. The development of the score prediction model is discussed through 
both mathematics and computer code to demonstrate the implementation of the model. We then compare several variations of this Neural Network method 
on an unseen set of cricket match data, before employing it on data from the 2019 Cricket World Cup, to see how the tournament would have differed in 
light of the new method. We found that our method didn't change the outcome of the tournament, but improved on the score targets set by the ICC's method.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Dr. Jessica Hargreaves for their invaluable supervision, encouragement and advice throughout this project. In addition,
many thanks to Michael Najdan at Kent County Cricket Club for their insight into how data is used in the professional game of cricket, and to Harrison Allen at Yorkshire County Cricket Club for demonstrating how limited-overs data was put into practice in preperation for games. 
I couldn't write a dissertation about cricket without mentioning the University of York Men's Cricket Club- it has been wonderful to share the playing field with you all over the past 4 years.
Finally, I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my friends from Lindley G; thank you for being the most wonderful and supportive people I've ever met. You'll never know how much you mean to me.
