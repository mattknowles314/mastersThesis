\chapter{Data}

\section{Data Origin}
The primary source of data for carrying out this project was downloaded from ``cricsheet''\footnote{https://cricsheet.org/}
and stored locally on a private server. In total there are 2167 individual matches of data. Each in a JSON format.
These cover matches ranging from the $3^{rd}$ of January, 2004. Up to the $20^{th}$ of July, 2021.

\section{Attributes}
Each JSON file contains a considerable amount of metadata surrounding the match in question. Along with 
ball-by-ball data for the entire match. We have access to attributes such as the date, where the match was played,
the entire teamsheet for both teams, who the officials were, who won- and by what margin, who won the toss; and many others.

We also have the ball-by-ball data. So for every ball bowled, it gives who were the striking and non-striking batsmen, how many runs
were scored and how. It also details if a wicket was taken that ball, and how.

\section{Pre-Processing}
Many Python scripts were written to get data in an appropriate form for analysis.
