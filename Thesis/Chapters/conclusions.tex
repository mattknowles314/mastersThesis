\section{Conclusions}




\section{Discussion and Future Work}
Following on from what was mentioned in Section~\ref{mcsim}, rather than simply decreasing scores in proportion with the number of overs loft, 
it would be worth investigating decreasing the score depending on the fall of wicket distribution, as we looked at earlier in the paper. This could be 
done using Bayesian Techniques.
