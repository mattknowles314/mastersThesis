# Statistical Methods for Reducing Score Targets in Limited-Overs Cricket

## Introduction

This project aims to look at new ways at solving the problem originally tackled by the DLS method. We look at Bayesian methods, 
as well as at using Neural Networks to try and predict cricket scores in games. 

### TODO

- Extension on the Bayes work?
- Put results table in an appendix
